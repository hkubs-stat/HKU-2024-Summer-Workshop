                Mark-point dependence plays a critical role in research problems that can be fitted into the general framework of marked point processes. In this work, we focus on adjusting for mark-point dependence when estimating the mean and covariance functions of the mark process, given independent replicates of the marked point process. We assume that the mark process is a Gaussian process and the point process is a log-Gaussian Cox process, where the mark-point dependence is generated through the dependence between two latent Gaussian processes. Under this framework, naive local linear estimators ignoring the mark-point dependence can be severely biased. We show that this bias can be corrected using a local linear estimator of the cross-covariance function and establish uniform convergence rates of the bias-corrected estimators. Furthermore, we propose a test statistic based on local linear estimators for mark-point independence, which is shown to converge to an asymptotic normal distribution in a parametric root n convergence rate. Model diagnostics tools are developed for key model assumptions and a robust functional permutation test is proposed for a more general class of mark-point processes. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using extensive simulations and applications to some real data examples.

                We consider a class of generalized linear mixed models in which both the number of groups and the number of observations within each group are large, and in which usual likelihood analysis encounters both computational and technical challenges. Matt Wand and colleagues have adapted the machine learning technique of expectation propagation (EP) to yield state-of-the-art estimation of parameters in such models. Here we ask: are the EP estimators asymptotically efficient? A main challenge is to define an appropriate objective function that captures the EP iteration and approximates maximum likelihood well enough to inherit its efficiency. A second issue is to show that maximum likelihood actually is efficient, due to integrals over random effects in the likelihood. For this we propose a novel method based on classical complex analysis. This is joint work with a group including the late Peter Hall, Matt Wand, Song Mei and Apratim Dey.

                We develop a statistical framework to learn the high-dimensional stochastic discount factor (SDF) from a large set of characteristic-based portfolios. Specifically, we build on the maximum-Sharpe ratio estimated and sparse regression method proposed in Ao, Li and Zheng (RFS,2019) to construct the SDF portfolio, and develop a statistical inference theory to test the SDF loadings. Applying our approach to 194 characteristic-based portfolios, we find that the SDF constructed by about 20 of them performs well in achieving a high Sharpe ratio and explaining the cross-section of expected returns of various portfolios.

                We propose an autoregressive framework for modelling dynamic networks with dependent edges. It encompasses the models which accommodate, for example, transitivity, density-dependent and other stylized features often observed in real network data. By assuming the edges of network at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in the straightforward manner. Due to the possible large number of parameters in the models, the initial MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration based on the projection which mitigates the impact of the other parameters. Based on a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the stationarityassumption. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, and it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions. Illustration with a transitivity model was carried out in both simulation and two real network data sets.
