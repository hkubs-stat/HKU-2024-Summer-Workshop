              Abstract: Given a sample of covariate-response pairs, we consider the
              subgroup selection problem of identifying a subset of the covariate domain
              where the regression function exceeds a pre-determined threshold. We
              introduce a computationally-feasible approach for subgroup selection in
              the context of multivariate isotonic regression based on martingale tests
              and multiple testing procedures for logically-structured hypotheses. Our
              proposed procedure satisfies a non-asymptotic, uniform Type I error rate
              guarantee with power that attains the minimax optimal rate up to
              poly-logarithmic factors. Extensions cover classification, isotonic
              quantile regression and heterogeneous treatment effect settings. Numerical
              studies on both simulated and real data confirm the practical
              effectiveness of our proposal, which is implemented in the R package ISS.

Abstract: In the existing literature of reinforcement learning (RL), off-policy evaluation is mainly focused on estimating a value (e.g., an expected discounted cumulative reward) of a target policy given the pre-collected data generated by some behavior policy. Motivated by the recent success of distributional RL in many practical applications, we study the distributional off-policy evaluation problem in the batch setting when the reward is multi-variate. We propose an offline Wasserstein-based approach to simultaneously estimate the joint distribution of a multivariate discounted cumulative reward given any initial state-action pair in the setting of an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. Finite sample error bound for the proposed estimator with respect to a modified Wasserstein metric is established in terms of both the number of trajectories and the number of decision points on each trajectory in the batch data. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. (Joint work with Zhengling Qi, Chenjia Bai, and Zhaoran Wang)

Abstract: We develop a general framework for constructing distribution-free prediction intervals for time series for a given black-box algorithm. Theoretically, we establish asymptotic marginal and conditional coverage guarantees of the prediction intervals while allowing for general temporal dependence and that the interval is asymptotically optimal compared with an oracle.  Methodologically, we introduce computationally efficient algorithms, EnbPI, SPCI, and an optimal kernel-based approach that wrap around ensemble predictors closely related to standard conformal prediction (CP) but do not require data exchangeability. We perform extensive simulation and real-data analyses to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with existing methods.

              Abstract: We will discuss PAC prediction sets, which predict sets of labels given any pre-trained machine learning method, and guarantee coverage of a large fraction of true labels with high probability over a calibration set. In the standard i.i.d. setting, they are equivalent to the training set conditional coverage property of inductive conformal prediction (Vovk 2012), and their coverage property is also equivalent to that of Wilks' tolerance regions. We will discuss recent progress (Park et al. 2022a,b, 2023) on using them in dataset shift settings where the test distribution is different from the calibration distribution.

              A conformal test of linear models via permutation-augmented regressions

                Abstract: Permutation tests are widely recognized as robust alternatives to tests based on normal theory. Random permutation tests have been frequently employed to assess the significance of variables in linear models. Despite their widespread use, existing random permutation tests lack finite-sample and assumption-free guarantees for controlling type I error in partial correlation tests. To address this ongoing challenge, we have developed a conformal test through permutation-augmented regressions, which we refer to as PALMRT. PALMRT not only achieves power competitive with conventional methods but also provides reliable control of type I errors at no more than 2α, given any targeted level α, for arbitrary fixed designs and error distributions. We have confirmed this through extensive simulations.   Compared to the cyclic permutation test (CPT) and residual permutation test (RPT), which also offer theoretical guarantees, PALMRT does not com- promise as much on power or set stringent requirements on the sample size, making it suitable for diverse biomedical applications. We further illustrate the differences in a long-Covid study where PALMRT validated key findings previously identified using the t-test after multiple corrections, while both CPT and RPT suffered from a drastic loss of power and failed to identify any discoveries. We endorse PALMRT as a robust and practical hypoth- esis test in scientific research for its superior error control, power preservation, and simplicity.

                Abstract: We study the problem of uncertainty quantification for time series prediction, with the goal of providing easy-to-use algorithms with formal guarantees. The algorithms we present build upon ideas from conformal prediction and control theory, are able to prospectively model conformal scores in an online setting, and adapt to the presence of systematic errors due to seasonality, trends, and general distribution shifts. Our theory both simplifies and strengthens existing analyses in online conformal prediction. Experiments on 4-week-ahead forecasting of statewide COVID-19 death counts in the U.S. show an improvement in coverage over the ensemble forecaster used in official CDC communications. We also run experiments on predicting electricity demand, market returns, and temperature using autoregressive, Theta, Prophet, and Transformer models. We provide an extendable codebase for testing our methods and for the integration of new algorithms, data sets, and forecasting rules.

              Abstract:  The ordinary differential equation (ODE) is widely used in modelling biological and physical processes in science. A new reproducing kernelbased approach is proposed for the estimation and inference of ODE given noisy observations. The functional forms in ODE are assumed to be known or restricted to be linear or additive, and pairwise interactions are allowed. Sparse estimation is performed to select individual functionals and construct confidence intervals for the estimated signal trajectories. The estimation optimality and selection consistency of kernel ODE are established under both the low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings, where the number of unknown functionals can be smaller or larger than the sample size. The proposal builds upon the smoothing spline analysis of variance (SS-ANOVA) framework, but tackles several important problems that are not yet fully addressed, and thus extends the scope of existing SS-ANOVA too.

              Abstract: With recent advances in natural language processing, rationalization becomes an essential self-explaining diagram to disentangle the black box by selecting a subset of input texts to account for the major variation in prediction. Yet, existing association-based approaches on rationalization cannot identify true rationales when two or more snippets are highly inter-correlated and thus provide a similar contribution to prediction accuracy, so-called spuriousness. To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

              Abstract: How can observational data be used to improve the design and analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)? We consider how to develop estimators to merge causal effect estimates obtained from observational and experimental datasets, when the two data sources measure the same treatment. We discuss two methods for deriving shrinkage estimators for this task: positing a shrinkage structure and minimizing an unbiased risk estimate; or using a hierarchical model. We develop several estimators under these frameworks. Next, we consider how these estimators might contribute to more efficient designs for prospective randomized trials. We show that the risk of a shrinkage estimator can be computed efficiently via numerical integration. We then propose algorithms for determining the experimental design -- that is, the best allocation of units to strata -- by optimizing over this computable shrinker risk.

Dynamic treatment effects: high-dimensional inference under model misspecification

              Abstract: Estimating dynamic treatment effects is essential across various disciplines, offering nuanced insights into the time-dependent causal impact of interventions. However, this estimation presents challenges due to the "curse of dimensionality" and time-varying confounding, which can lead to biased estimates. Additionally, correctly specifying the growing number of treatment assignments and outcome models with multiple exposures seems overly complex. Given these challenges, the concept of double robustness, where model misspecification is permitted, is extremely valuable, yet unachieved in practical applications. This paper introduces a new approach by proposing novel, robust estimators for both treatment assignments and outcome models. We present a "sequential model double robust" solution, demonstrating that double robustness over multiple time points can be achieved when each time exposure is doubly robust. This approach improves the robustness and reliability of dynamic treatment effects estimation, addressing a significant gap in this field.
