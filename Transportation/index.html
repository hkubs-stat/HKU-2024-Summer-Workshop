    <br><b> Recommended Hotels: </b><br>
    <p>

    There are a number of accommodation options close to the HKU campus, including international chains and local brands. The following two hotels are within walking distance to HKU campus, and the directions from hotel to the venue are provided:

    <ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/hkgcy-courtyard-hong-kong/overview/">Courtyard by Marriott Hong Kong</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Courtyard+by+Marriott+Hong+Kong/@22.2879503,114.1388476,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x3403ff816fb2a5f3:0x50f3e858658d2e8a!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d22.2879503!4d114.1388476!16s%2Fg%2F155t1f_y?entry=ttu">google map</a>)</b>:</li>
        The most efficient walking path is to get into the HKU MTR station (from exit B1 to A2), walk underground, and take the elevator up to the campus.  The walk from the hotel to HKU MTR station takes about 8 minutes, and the walk from HKU station to the Jockey Club Tower takes another 8-10 minutes.  OR a taxi ride for about 5 mins at a cost of approximately HKD40.
